	<h3>But first, there's a few things you're going to need to do to use eSignHealth:</h3>
		<h4>First, let's get you a template or two uploaded.</h4>
		<p>
		It's pretty simple to do, just click the "My Templates" link in the navigation bar, then click "Create a New Template".  We only accept PDF documents as of right now, with support for other formats in the works.  You can have up to ten templates associated with your account.
	<br><br>
		Here's something really important:<i><b> Please do not include any PHI in your template.</b>  Templates are stored securely, but not encrypted like completed documents. </i>

		<h4>Next, set a signature position if your document requires a signature.</h4>
			<p>This too is pretty painless.  Just find the template you just uploaded in your templates listing and click "Set Signature Position".  From there, all you need to do is click on the location where you want to place your signer's signature.  The signatures are centered within the green area. </p><br><br>
